Welcome to A.P.E.S!
A.P.E.S was SimulApes, but we have changed the name.
The game is being remade, this is a teaser update to test the things we want to test out.

fun fact of the day
Days on Venus are longer than years. Due to its slow axis rotation, it takes 243 Earth days to spin once; but it only takes 225 Earth days to go around the sun
